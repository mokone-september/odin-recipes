    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>In a large pot, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. Set aside.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 3/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over sauce. Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>Cover with foil (to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese).</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
