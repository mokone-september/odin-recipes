# Project Title: The Odin Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a [brief description of the app or tool you're building — e.g., "job application tracker", "weather dashboard", "e-commerce site", etc.], developed as part of my ongoing journey in software development. It serves both as a practical implementation of modern development tools and a platform to enhance and demonstrate my technical and problem-solving skills.

The application includes core functionalities such as [list main features — e.g., CRUD operations, responsive design, authentication, API integration, etc.], and focuses on delivering a seamless and accessible user experience.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

- **Frontend Development**
  - React / Vue / Next.js (depending on what you’re using)
  - Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules
  - TypeScript / JavaScript

- **Backend & APIs**
  - Node.js / Express
  - RESTful APIs or GraphQL
  - MongoDB / PostgreSQL

- **State Management & Data Handling**
  - Context API / Redux / TanStack Query

## ✨ Self-Reflection (To be completed after the project)

> After completing this project, I’ve gained deeper insights into:

- [e.g., Efficient component composition in React]
- [e.g., Handling asynchronous data with TanStack Query]
- [e.g., Building scalable folder structures]
- [e.g., Debugging API integrations]
- [e.g., Writing cleaner, more maintainable TypeScript]

This project has not only sharpened my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of consistency, testing, and documentation in software development.
